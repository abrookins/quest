## Querying [15 mins]

* Pagination
    * Before -- http://localhost:8000/analytics
    * Look at code: .all() all items
    * Open DB console and get # of items in table
    * Use pagination (offset) http://localhost:8000/analytics_offset
    * Debug Toolbar - # of queries, speed
    * Preview: Keyset Pagination
        * Explain why you would need this (DB still has to get rows, deep results can break/be slow)
        * CursorPagination with DRF - only show it
        * Refer to book for more
* Annotations ("Aggregations")
    * What is an annotation?
    * Counting with Python - http://localhost:8000/admin/goal_dashboard_sql/
    * Counting with SQL/Annotations - http://localhost:8000/admin/goal_dashboard_sql/
    
* Materialized Views
    * Explanation - like caching in the database
    * Code [model for materialized view, code for migration]
        * GoalSummary
        * migration: goals 0014
    * Run the migration
    * View http://localhost:8000/admin/goal_dashboard_materialized/
    * Show refresh_summaries management command


## Indexing [15 mins]

* Covering indexes
    * An index that can service a query itself, not using a table  
        * Why? Faster
    * First we need to add an index - show index definition
    * Look at migration: AddIndexConcurrently new in Django 3
        * Explanation (building indexes locks tables, concurrently doesnâ€™t)
    * Show queries in database panel
    * Explain analyze query with index - Database Panel
    * Should be index-only
    * May NOT be index-only query yet
        * VACUUM if needed
    * Run query again - should be index only
    
 * Partial indexes
     * Difference compared to regular index
        * Use to EXCLUDE common data from the index (better write perf, smaller index)
     * Show index definition analytics/models.py
     * Run query again - should be index only
   

## Caching and Beyond Caching with Redis [15]

* Using the caching framework
    * Why redis? The swiss-army knife of databases
    * Code [Settings.py - turn on caching with redis]
    * Show middleware -- will cache entire site -- disabled
    * Admin dashboard Redis version -- caching the calculated values in Redis
    
* Session storage with Redis

    * Explanation
    * Code [settings.py]
    * Demo: log in, examine redis keys with database tool in PyCharm
    
* Custom auth backend for token storage in Redis with DRF
    * Explanation [looking up auth tokens is slow, use redis]
    * Code [custom auth backend] accounts/authentication.py
    * Create a token in redis-cli
    * Check that we can authenticate using the token
